    "#### Area I think I improved:\n",
    "* **Work Habits**: I'm better at working during class now! I used to only be able to focus at home but I feel like I can definitely get a lot more done during class.\n",
    "* **Timeliness**: I feel a lot more confident in getting things done on time, and I think everything I got done on time!\n",
    "* **Tech, Cyber Sense and Cyber Talk**: I feel like not only am I better able to follow what goes on in more and more complex code, but I also have an expanded vocabulary when it comes to talking about these topics. With the expanded vocabulary, I feel like it's easier to understand new stuff as well, because I have the words needed to associate things. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Areas I can Improve on Next Tri:\n",
    "* **Work Habits and Timeliness**: These areas can always be improved, and I am in no way perfect. There are still times when I'm not 100% productive. There are also still times when I leave things for the last minute. In the future, I would like to try my best to work as hard as I can when assignments are assigned, trying my best to make the most of worktime given in class.\n",
    "* **Tech, Cyber Sense and Cyber Talk**: Obviously, this is pretty much the main part of class! I by no means know everything about computer science, so I'm always willing to improve and learn more about technology and how I can expand my vocabulary when talking about it. \n",

    "## 3 Sprints: Key Ideas\n",
    "Over this trimester, we've gone through three seperate sprints with 3 distinct ideas, that flow well into eachother.\n",
    "#### Sprint 1:\n",
    "* focused mostly on getting set-up, which would help us greatly later when needing to use these tools. \n",
    "* setting up virtual environment would be helpful later, especially during sprint 2 when doing python lessons and homework.\n",
    "* A highlight of this sprint for me was our gamified on-boarding lesson. This helped reinforce the ideas I was learning and helped cement them to me as I taught them to others. \n",
    "#### Sprint 2:\n",
    "* Helped develop the basic skills of compsci in lesson and homework format.\n",
    "* Found this super technical learning-focused sprint to be helpful in advance to sprint 3, where we applied a lot of these concepts. \n",
    "* A highlight of this sprint was teaching the lessons, when teaching I felt like I could really understand everything I explained, and it even helped me learn things when others asked me questions and we had to work it out together. \n",
    "#### Sprint 3:\n",
    "* real-world applications of fundamentals we learned from sprint 1 and 2.\n",
    "* made it in a more interesting interconnected format than just learning from more lessons like sprint 2.\n",
    "* A highlight for this sprint was N@TM, where we could show off a cummulative product of all the work we had been doing for the past weeks. "

    "\n",
    "#### Memorable Comments:\n",
    "* Avantika's Dad told me after I finished explaining that I was using a more advanced vocabulary than he thought this level would have, and that felt good because it felt like I really understood the material.\n",
    "* My friend I brought along with me said I looked more confident when explaining than I usually do. \n",

    "## What Next?\n",
    "With the addition of microblogs into our site, I like the idea of social media! For our next project, I'd like to lean into the social media aspect a little further and make what could be a fully fledged social media site. I feel like with social media, it could also show how these skills we learn in class translate into real world applications, with such a popular thing like social media. It could also give an insight into things like what a computer science position looks like for somebody who works for one of these social media sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, I'd like to learn in the future skills that went along with this, things like running frontend and backend, dealing with data science and data structures, as well as databases for storage. Also, because our group briefly dived into CRUD procedures, I'd like to maybe do more with that in the future and actually apply it to databases in the future. Also, learning how we can turn concepts as broad as databases and CRUD procedures and how we're able to use it in real world applications. "
