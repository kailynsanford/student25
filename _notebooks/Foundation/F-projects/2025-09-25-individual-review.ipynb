    "- **Order**: Each element has a position, starting at index `0`.  \n",

    "- **Iteration**: You can go through each item in a list one by one.  \n",
    "- **Common Uses**:  \n",
    "  - Storing related data together (like a shopping list or group of scores).  \n",
    "  - Organizing items that may need to be changed over time.  \n",
    "  - Keeping track of sequences, steps, or collections in a program.  \n",
